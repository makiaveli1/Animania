## Description

Welcome to Animania, the ultimate anime quiz game! In this game, players are presented with multiple-choice questions about various anime series. The aim is to answer correctly to score points and climb up the leaderboard.

### Project Background

The project was inspired by a love for anime and the desire to create an interactive platform where anime enthusiasts can test their knowledge. It aims to provide a fun, engaging experience while educating players on different aspects of anime.

## UX Design

### Goals

- Create a fun and interactive quiz game centered around anime.
- Provide an easy-to-navigate and visually appealing user interface.

### Design Choices

The design is inspired by vibrant anime aesthetics, with the use of lively colors and dynamic fonts. The layout is clean and straightforward, aiming to provide an immersive user experience without overwhelming the player.

#### Typography

- **Main Font**: 'Just Me Again Down Here' from Google Fonts, used for its playful and engaging appearance.
- **Secondary Font**: 'Source Serif Pro' & 'Pangolin', used for their readability and modern appeal.

### Color Scheme

The project employs a carefully selected color scheme to enhance user engagement and aesthetic appeal. Below is the breakdown:

#### Background Colors

- Light Gray: `#c4c4c4`
- Yellow: `#ffbb00`
- Dark Yellow: `#fec833`
- Black with opacity: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)`
- Gradient: `linear-gradient(to right, rgba(135, 79, 54, 0.81), rgba(179, 173, 166, 0.81), rgba(176, 138, 77, 0.56))`

#### Text Colors

- White: `#fff` and `#fcfcfc`
- Black: `#000`
- Dark Gray: `rgb(19, 18, 18)`

#### Special Cases

- Correct Answers: `green`
- Wrong Answers: `red`

#### Imagery

Images were generated through Leonardo.ai and then vectorized using Vectorizer.ai for efficient and clean rendering. The SVG format ensures scalability without loss of quality.

### Wireframes

Wireframes serve as the blueprint for the design and layout of the application. They offer a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of the application. Below are the wireframes for different parts of the Animania project:

#### Mobile Look

These wireframes were designed to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining a clean and attractive interface.

## Features

- **Index Page**: The landing page offers an introduction to the game and a 'Start Quiz' button.
- **Quiz Page**: Players are directed here to take the quiz, which consists of multiple-choice questions.

## Game Mechanics

The game incorporates a timer for each question, pushing players to think on their feet. Each correct answer earns the player points, which are tallied at the end to determine the final score.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For structuring the content.
- CSS: For styling the interface.
- JavaScript: For implementing interactive features.

### Technical Choices

The project uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no additional libraries. Google Fonts were used for typography, and images were generated and converted using Leonardo.ai and Vectorizer.ai, respectively. All code has undergone extensive testing, including Lighthouse, HTML, CSS, and JS validation.

## Testing

Testing is a crucial aspect of the development process. For Animania, we employed a variety of tests to ensure the game's reliability and efficiency.

### Code Validation

#### HTML Validation

The HTML code was verified using the W3C Markup Validator. The test confirmed that all pages are compliant with current HTML5 standards. This helps in ensuring that the website functions consistently across different web browsers.

#### CSS Validation

The CSS code was validated through the W3C CSS Validator. The code passed the test, which means it is well-structured and free of any syntax errors.

#### JavaScript Validation

For JavaScript, the JSHint tool was used. This tool is excellent for detecting errors and potential problems in JavaScript code. No issues were found during the validation process, ensuring that the game logic is robust and efficient.

### Performance Testing

#### Lighthouse Testing

Performance testing was done using Google Lighthouse. This tool provides valuable insights into various performance metrics such as load time, accessibility, and SEO. Animania scored high in all these areas, indicating that the website is well-optimized.

## Testing

Code validation was performed using various online tools, and the results can be found in the `assets/images/validation-images/` folder. Lighthouse testing was also performed to ensure optimal performance and accessibility.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into separate folders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, making it easier to navigate. Each file serves a specific purpose:

- **HTML Files**: Handle the layout and structure.
  - `index.html`: The main landing page.
  - `quiz.html`: The quiz interface.
- **CSS Files**: Manage the styling.
  - `style.css`: General styles that apply to the entire project.
  - `quiz_style.css`: Styles specific to the quiz.
- **JavaScript Files**: Implement the game logic.
  - `questions.js`: Stores the quiz questions.
  - `quiz.js`: Manages the quiz gameplay.
  - `script.js`: Handles general JavaScript functionalities.

## Deployment

Animania is currently hosted on GitHub Pages, a static site hosting service. The site is automatically updated with each commit to the GitHub repository. [here](https://makiaveli1.github.io/Animania/).
